**Choosing a journal**

In this blog post, I provide a decision tree along with that might help you choose the most suitable journal for publishing your research. Iâ€™ll share tips and useful links to get you started, focusing on key factors such as journal scope, open access fees, impact factor, DOI, peer review process, and publication timelines. 

I briefly share my own experiences. In addition, I offer a not-extensive list of journals that publish ornithological research, complete with a map to guide your selection.

This resource goal is to be a guide for those looking to submit their first paper into an ornithological journal.
