# Intro

Offshore oil and gas operations activities can have environmental impacts throughout their entire lifecycle, including exploration, production, and decommissioning. Potential impacts include the discharge of produced water, oil, chemicals, drilling muds, and cuttings; physical disturbances from the installation of infrastructure and pipelines; noise generated by seismic surveys and drilling; light pollution from installations; and atmospheric emissions.

# Data

The dataset on offshore installations for Oil and Gas exploitation and exploration activities was created in 2015 by Cogea for the European Marine Observation and Data Network (EMODnet). <br>
It is the result of the aggregation and harmonization of datasets provided by several EU and non-EU sources. It is updated every year, and is available for viewing and download on EMODnet Human Activities web portal (https://emodnet.ec.europa.eu/en/human-activities). <br>
It contains points representing offshore installations and where available each point has the following attributes: ID, name, country, location block, operator, production start year, primary production, current status, category and function of the installation, sub-structure and topside weights (tonnes), water depth (metres), distance to coast (metres) and notes. <br>


# Read shapefile

```{r}
library(here)
library(sf)
```

```{r, echo=TRUE}
This_directory<-here()
```

```{r,echo=FALSE}
This_directory<-"C:/Users/lerma/OneDrive/Documents/03Academico/02Proyectos-Postdoc/2025/1Programming/1Distill/Tests"
#list.files(This_directory)
```

```{r}
This_file<-"/EMODnet_HA_OG_Offshore_Installations_20240216.shp"
```

```{r, message=FALSE, include=FALSE}
Oil_shapefile<-st_read(paste0(This_directory,This_file))
```

# Visualize

Use ggplot to visualize the information.  

```{r, include=FALSE}
head(Oil_shapefile)
```

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r}
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = Oil_shapefile)
```

# Filter

The OSPAR commission source covers data for Germany, Ireland, Spain (Atlantic Sea), while for Italy data have been collected and harmonized from the Italian Ministry of Economic Development, for Denmark from the Danish Energy Agency, for the Netherlands from the TNO - Geological Survey of the Netherlands, for Croatia from the Croatian Hydrocarbon Agency, for Norway from the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate, for the UK from the Oil and Gas Authority (surface infrastructures), for Polish and Russian installations in the Baltic Sea from Marine Traffic and Helcom, finally from Marine Traffic come the data for Bulgarian, Russian and Ukrainian installations in the Black Sea and for Lybian and Spanish installations in the Mediterranean Sea. Compared with the previous version this new version has been updated for all countries.<br>

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
unique(Oil_shapefile$COUNTRY)
```

Load tidyverse to make a filter.

```{r, message=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
```
Keep only Germany data.

```{r, message=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
Oil_germany<-Oil_shapefile %>%
  filter(COUNTRY == 'Germany')
```

Use **geom_sf** to visualize the points. There are only 3 data points for Germany.

```{r}
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = Oil_germany)
```


# Base Map

Create a base map using shapefiles from the package GermanNorthSea

```{r}
library(GermanNorthSea)
```

Add the attributes and the theme to your base map.

```{r, fig.height=6, fig.width=8}
Base_map<-ggplot() + 
  # Fill colors
  geom_sf(data = GermanNorthSea::German_EEZ, color='#43585E',fill='transparent',alpha=0.1, linewidth = 1)+
  geom_sf(data = German_land, colour = '#43585E', fill = '#43585E')+
  
  geom_sf(data = GermanNorthSea::German_SCA, colour = '#43585E', fill = NA, 
          linewidth=0.1, linetype = "dashed",alpha=0.3)+
  geom_sf(data = GermanNorthSea::German_natura, colour = '#43585E', fill = NA, 
          linewidth=0.1, linetype = "dashed",alpha=0.3)+
  
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(4,6,8),labels = function(x) paste0(x, '\u00B0')) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(53.5,54.5,55.5),labels = function(x) paste0(x, '\u00B0'))  +
  
  theme(
  axis.text.x = element_text(size=10,vjust = 12,color='#3d5a80'),
  axis.text.y = element_text(color='#3d5a80',size=10,margin = margin(0,-1.30,0,1, unit = 'cm')),
  axis.title = element_blank(),
  axis.ticks.length=unit(-0.20, "cm"),
  panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
  panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
  panel.background = element_rect(fill = '#F2F2F2'))+
  
  xlab('Longitude')+ylab('Latitude')+
  
  theme(panel.border = element_rect(colour = "black", fill=NA, size=1.5))
Base_map+
  coord_sf(xlim = c(3900000,4250000), ylim = c(3350000,3680000),
                    label_axes = list(left = "N", bottom = 'E'))
```


## Add names

Using annotate, add the names of the platforms.

```{r, fig.height=6, fig.width=8}
Oil_1plot<-Base_map+
  geom_sf(data = Oil_germany)+
  
  coord_sf(xlim = c(3900000,4250000), ylim = c(3350000,3680000),
                    label_axes = list(left = "N", bottom = 'E'))+
  
  annotate("text", 
           x = 4177000, y = 3438000, label = "Mittelplate A",size=5, color="#ffb400")+
  annotate("segment", 
           x = 4215000, xend = 4235000,
           y =  3435700, yend = 3435700,colour = 'black')+
  
  annotate("text", 
           x = 3989000, y = 3648000, label = "A6-A",size=5,colour ="#bb3e03" )+
  annotate("segment", 
           x =  3946000+1000, xend = 3968000,
           y = 3648200, yend =  3648200, color= 'black')
Oil_1plot
```


## Add title

The package ggtext allows to add colors into labels.

```{r}
library(ggtext)
```

Add the title on the map.

```{r, fig.height=6, fig.width=8}
Oil_1plot +
  geom_richtext(aes(x =  3891000, y = 3419000,
  label = "Offshore installations for<br>
  <span style='color:#ffb400'>Oil</span>
  and
  <span style='color:#bb3e03'>Gas</span>
  exploitation <br>and exploration  in the <br>German North Sea"), 
  size = 5, 
  fill = NA, 
  label.color = NA, # remove background and outline
  hjust = 0,
  vjust= 0,
  inherit.aes = TRUE
  )+
  NULL
```

### Places description

**Mittleplate A**

Mittelplate is Germany’s largest oil field, located 7 km (4.3 mi) offshore in the ecologically sensitive tidal flats of the Schleswig-Holstein Wadden Sea National Park. The field was developed by a joint venture between RWE Dea and Wintershall. By the 20th anniversary of production, the field had yielded approximately 20 million tonnes (22 million tons), or about 146 million barrels, of crude oil. Mittelplate contains nearly 65% of Germany’s total crude oil reserves. Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mittelplate)

**A6-A**

A6/B4 is Germany’s only operational offshore gas field, located about 300 km off the coast in the North Sea, within Germany’s exclusive economic zone. Discovered in 1974 and producing since 2000, it supplies around 5% of Germany’s natural gas. By the end of 2006, it had produced 6.7 billion cubic meters. 
Operated by the German North Sea Consortium, with Wintershall Noordzee B.V. managing production, the platform sits in 48 meters of water and typically hosts ten workers. Gas and condensate are piped to a Dutch platform, where the condensate is shipped and the gas sent to the mainland via the NOGAT pipeline. Source: [Wikipedia](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/A6/B4)
