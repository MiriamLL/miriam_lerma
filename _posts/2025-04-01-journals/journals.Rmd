**Choosing a journal**

In this blog post, I provide a decision tree with that might help you choose the most suitable journal for publishing your research.  
Iâ€™ll also share tips and links to get you started, focusing on journal scope, open access fees, impact factor, DOI, peer review process, and publication timelines.  

I briefly share my own experiences. In addition, I offer a brief list of journals that publish ornithological research, complete with a map to guide your selection.  

The goal is to be a guide for those looking to submit papers into an ornithological journals.
