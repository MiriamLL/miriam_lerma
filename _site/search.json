Humboldt penguins (Spheniscus\r\nhumboldti) are exposed to increasing anthropogenic impacts in their\r\nnatural habitat. In this species, females are typically smaller and dive\r\nless deep than males. In related species, the more limited foraging\r\nhabitat of females and their reduced resiliency due to their smaller\r\nsize were associated with higher mortality. We hypothesise that\r\npotential sex-specific differences in the foraging behaviour of Humboldt\r\npenguins may also relate to differences in their physiological stress.\r\nHere, we studied sex-specific foraging and diving behaviours and\r\nvariations in plasma corticosterone levels and leukocyte profiles of\r\nHumboldt penguins during the chick-rearing period in Northern Chile. We\r\nreport no evidence of sex-related differences in most foraging\r\nparameters, except that males dived significantly deeper than females.\r\nWe found that plasma corticosterone levels and leukocyte profiles showed\r\nno significant differences between the sexes. Furthermore, there was no\r\nclear relationship between an individual’s foraging behaviour and its\r\nplasma corticosterone level or leukocyte profile. In summary, we found\r\nno support for sex-related differences in physiological stress levels of\r\nHumboldt penguins, and no link between their foraging behaviour and\r\ntheir physiological stress. However, we acknowledge that our sample size\r\nis small and that more studies are needed. This study contributes with\r\ninformation on the physiological stress and foraging behaviours of\r\nHumboldt penguins in Northern Chile. This information can help to\r\nunderstand context-dependent differences in physiological parameters and\r\nforaging behaviours for the species.Read more: Link\r\nto publication\r\n2022\r\n9.\r\nNutritional state variations in a tropical seabird throughout its\r\nbreeding season\r\nAuthors: Lerma M, Dehnhard N,\r\nCastillo-Guerrero JA, Fernandez GAbstract Individual body condition is frequently used\r\nto explain differences in foraging and breeding ecology in seabirds.\r\nHowever, little is known about the covariations of body mass with the\r\nnutritional state of animals as measured through plasma metabolites and\r\nhow these different measures vary between and within individuals during\r\nbreeding. Here, we assessed intra-individual variations of plasma\r\nmetabolites (triglycerides, cholesterol, protein, and ß-hydroxybutyrate\r\nconcentrations) and in body mass of Blue-footed boobies (Sula\r\nnebouxii) throughout their breeding season 2011–2012 in Isla El\r\nRancho, Mexico. We found breeding-stage and sex-specific variations in\r\nindividuals’ plasma metabolite concentrations, but these did not mirror\r\nvariations in body mass. Before egg-laying, females had higher\r\ntriglycerides, cholesterol, and protein concentrations than males. In\r\ncontrast, males used their nutritional reserves (higher\r\nß-hydroxybutyrate concentrations) more than females during the breeding\r\nseason (except for early chick-rearing). At the individual level, males\r\ngained weight during the breeding season, whereas females lost weight.\r\nWe also found that between-individual differences in plasma metabolite\r\nconcentrations and changes in body mass were not consistent throughout\r\nthe breeding season, while individual body mass was significantly\r\nrepeatable. This study contributes to a better understanding of seabird\r\nbreeding ecology and physiology by showing that sex-specific breeding\r\nroles might highly influence the nutritional state. Similar patterns\r\nmight occur in other seabird species, helping to explain why we can find\r\nstage- and sex-specific foraging behaviors even in monomorphic\r\nspecies.Read more: Full\r\npublication\r\n2020\r\n8.\r\nBreeding stage, not sex, affects foraging characteristics in masked\r\nboobies at Rapa Nui\r\nAuthors: Lerma M, Dehnhard N,\r\nLuna-Jorquera G, Voigt CC, Garthe SAbstract Sexual segregation in foraging occurs in some\r\nspecies and populations of boobies (Sulidae), but it is not a general\r\npattern. Sexual segregation in foraging may occur to avoid competition\r\nfor food, and this competition may intensify during specific stages of\r\nbreeding. We examined sexual segregation in foraging in relation to\r\nbreeding stage in masked boobies Sula dactylatra at Rapa Nui by\r\ntracking simultaneously incubating and chick-rearing birds using GPS\r\nrecorders (n = 18) and collected a total of 11 regurgitate samples.\r\nStable isotope analyses (δ13C and δ15N) of whole blood samples were\r\ncarried out in 20 birds. There were no differences in foraging trip\r\nparameters or diet between females and males. Both sexes traveled\r\nfarther and for longer while incubating than while rearing chicks.\r\nIsotopic niches (δ13C and δ15N) overlapped to some degree among all\r\ngroups at all times, but the lowest overlap between sexes occurred\r\nduring incubation. While preying on ephemerally distributed flying fish,\r\nvertical or horizontal competition avoidance may be almost impossible,\r\nand thus females and males share their foraging grounds. Since birds\r\nwere tracked simultaneously, shorter foraging trips of chick-rearing\r\nbirds must be an effect of the constraints of provisioning the chick.\r\nDifferences observed in δ15N and δ13C values between sexes may be caused\r\nby subtle differences in their foraging behaviors, or by differences in\r\nphysiology linked to breeding. Our findings suggest that local\r\noceanography and its inherent food distribution are determinants for\r\nsexual segregation in foraging patterns in masked boobies and possibly\r\nalso other booby species.Read more: Full\r\npublication\r\n7.\r\nForaging ranges of Humboldt penguins Spheniscus humboldti from\r\nTilgo island: the critical need for protecting a unique marine\r\nhabitat\r\nAuthors: Quispe R, Lerma M, Luna N,\r\nPortflitt-Toro M, Serratosa J, Luna-JorqueraAbstract The largest population of Humboldt Penguins\r\nresides in a fertile archipelago of the north-central coast of Chile,\r\nformed by eight islands in proximity to upwelling centers of the\r\nHumboldt Current System. However, five of these islands lack legal\r\nprotection. Here, we report the results of breeding Humboldt Penguins\r\ntracked while foraging from Tilgo Island. The average and maximum\r\nforaging radii around the colony were 22 km and 43 km, respectively. Our\r\ndata indicate that trip ranges overlap areas proposed for industrial\r\nprojects. Because Humboldt Penguins are sentinels of local ecosystem\r\nhealth, this underscores the value of expanding conservation zones in\r\nthis unique marine location.Read more: Full\r\npublication\r\n6.\r\nForaging ecology of a marine top predator in the Eastern Tropical\r\nPacific over 3 years with different ENSO phases\r\nAuthors: Lerma M, Castillo-Guerrero\r\nJA Hernandez-Vazquez S, Garthe SAbstract The El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a\r\nrecurrent climatic pattern with important ecological consequences for\r\nseabirds due to its impacts on the abundance and distribution of food\r\nresources. We investigated the effects of ENSO phases on the foraging\r\necology of a marine top predator at Clarion Island in the Eastern\r\nTropical Pacific using GPS and time-depth recorder data and regurgitates\r\nfrom incubating masked boobies (Sula dactylatra) during 3\r\nconsecutive years. Foraging locations were recorded in 2016 (El Niño,\r\none female, three males), 2017 (neutral; six females, nine males), and\r\n2018 (La Niña; eight females, ten males). Local sea surface temperature\r\n(SST) and chlorophyll-a concentration (CHL) within the birds’ foraging\r\nrange were compared among the 3 years. Regurgitates were collected\r\nopportunistically from 25 and 31 incubating adults in 2017 and 2018,\r\nrespectively. Average local CHL and SST were similar among years (mean\r\nSST 25 °C; mean CHL 0.10 and of 0.09 mg m−3 in January and March,\r\nrespectively). Masked boobies travelled a maximum of 66 ± 34 km from the\r\ncolony. The maximum trip duration was 7.7 ± 3.4 h and total distance\r\ntravelled during a foraging trip was 164 ± 73 km, with no sex- or\r\nyear-related differences. Masked boobies mainly caught flying fish, but\r\ntheir diet also included one squid and six other fish families. In\r\ncontrast to previously reported changes in foraging ecology of seabirds,\r\nmasked boobies at Clarion Island seemed to be unaffected during El Niño,\r\nbecause the local oceanography was relatively unperturbed by ENSO\r\noscillations.Read more: Full\r\npublication\r\n5.\r\nForaging ecology of masked boobies (Sula dactylatra) in the\r\nworld’s largest ‘oceanic desert’\r\nAuthors: Lerma M, Serratosa J,\r\nLuna-Jorquera G, Garthe SAbstract The South Pacific Gyre has the most\r\nhyper-oligotrophic waters in the world and is considered the largest\r\n“oceanic desert.” Rapa Nui (Easter Island), located within the South\r\nPacific Gyre, is a breeding ground for masked boobies (Sula\r\ndactylatra), which are seabirds with a foraging range that\r\neffectively confines them within the gyre. The foraging ecology of this\r\nspecies in the gyre was examined by attaching GPS and time-depth devices\r\nto chick-rearing adult birds (9 and 14 birds in 2016 and 2017,\r\nrespectively) and by collecting regurgitates (18 and 15 samples in 2016\r\nand 2017, respectively). In addition, the birds’ foraging ecology\r\nbetween years was compared. Masked boobies traveled in various\r\ndirections, dived at unspecific locations, and explored areas < 110\r\nkm from the colony. Local environmental conditions were not\r\nsignificantly different between years, and differences in foraging\r\nparameters (maximum foraging range, trip duration, and dive depth) were\r\ngreater among individuals than between years. The foraging\r\ncharacteristics of masked boobies suggest that resources were\r\nephemerally distributed around the colony, with similar abundances\r\nacross years. Under these conditions, traveling to unspecific locations\r\nmay increase the area covered and the probability of prey encounter. The\r\nspatial and temporal consistencies in environmental conditions explain\r\nthe uniformity of foraging parameters between years. The ability of\r\nmasked boobies to exploit ephemerally distributed resources in seascapes\r\nlike Rapa Nui may help explain its pantropical distribution.Read more: Full\r\npublication\r\n4.\r\nZinc concentrations in Blue-footed booby (Sula nebouxii) eggs,\r\nnestlings, and adults\r\nAuthors: Lerma M, Castillo-Guerrero\r\nJA, Garcia-Hernandez J, Fernandez GAbstract Zinc is essential for animal metabolism, but\r\nthe variation in Zn concentrations within seabird populations has been\r\nseldom explored. We collected Blue-footed booby (Sula nebouxii)\r\neggs during 2012 and 2013 and blood samples from nestlings and adults\r\nduring 2011 and 2012 in Sinaloa, Mexico, to evaluate differences in Zn\r\nconcentrations among years, ages, sexes, and breeding stages. Zinc\r\nconcentrations in eggs ranged between 27.3 and 64.9 ppm (dry weight),\r\nwhereas Zn levels in the blood of nestlings and adults ranged between\r\n16.1 and 53.1 ppm (dry weight). Egg Zn concentrations did not differ due\r\nto developmental stage, although Zn concentrations were significantly\r\nhigher in 2013 than in 2012. Nestling Zn concentrations differed between\r\nyears and decreased gradually with age. Chicks had significantly higher\r\nZn concentrations than those of adults. Once nestlings stopped growing,\r\nfemales presented higher Zn concentrations than males. Adult Zn\r\nconcentrations were higher during the pre-laying period than during the\r\nother breeding stages. Our results suggest that growth, sex, and\r\nbreeding stage affect blood Zn concentrations, which may be due to\r\nstage-specific requirements. When compared with those of other seabird\r\nspecies, the Zn concentrations reported here are intermediate, and we\r\ndid not detect adverse effects on either nestlings or adults.Read more: Full\r\npublication\r\n2017\r\n3.\r\nNon-Breeding Distribution, Abundance, and Roosting Habitat Use of the\r\nAmerican Oystercatcher (Haematopus palliatus frazari) in\r\nSinaloa, Mexico\r\nAuthors: Lerma M, Castillo-Guerrero\r\nJA, Palacios EAbstract The American Oystercatcher (Haematopus\r\npalliatus frazari) is federally listed as endangered in Mexico due\r\nto habitat loss and small population size. Recent surveys indicate that\r\nthe State of Sinaloa supports about half of the breeding population in\r\nMexico. However, no information is available about the non-breeding\r\necology in Mexico. To assess American Oystercatcher distribution,\r\nabundance, and roosting habitat use during the nonbreeding season (3\r\nAugust 2014-23 January 2015), six bays were surveyed in Sinaloa. A total\r\nof 1,351 American Oystercatchers were detected using this area based on\r\nmaximum count per roosting site at or near high tide. American\r\nOystercatchers roosted in flocks of variable size (3–253 individuals per\r\nflock) with Bahía Santa María hosting the main roosting sites in\r\nSinaloa. Mangrove islands and mudflats had larger numbers of individuals\r\nthan expected relative to the availability of those habitats. The\r\nnon-breeding Sinaloa population comprised approximately 45.0% of the\r\ntotal H. p. frazari population estimate (n = 3,000 individuals). Bahía\r\nSanta María represented 74.6% of the non-breeding population observed in\r\nSinaloa. Thus, Sinaloa, and particularly Bahía Santa María, stand out as\r\ncritical sites for the conservation of this subspecies. Hypothesized\r\nthreats to American Oystercatchers were predators, livestock, and human\r\nactivities.Read more: Full Publication\r\n2.\r\nLead, cadmium and mercury in the blood of the blue-footed booby\r\n(Sula nebouxii) from the coast of Sinaloa, Gulf of California,\r\nMexico\r\nAuthors: Lerma M, Castillo-Guerrero\r\nJA, Ruelas-Inzunza J, Fernandez, GAbstract We used blood samples of the Blue-footed\r\nBooby, considering sex (female and male) and age-class (adult and chick)\r\nof individuals at different breeding stages during two breeding seasons\r\n(2010–2011 and 2011–2012) in Isla El Rancho, Sinaloa, to determine lead,\r\ncadmium, and mercury concentrations. Lead and cadmium concentrations\r\nwere below our detection limit (0.05 and 0.36 ppm, respectively). A\r\nhigher concentration of mercury was found in early stages of breeding,\r\nlikely related to changes in mercury environmental availability. Mercury\r\nconcentrations in adults did not relate with their breeding output.\r\nMales and adults had higher mercury concentration than females and\r\nchicks. We provide information of temporal, sex and age-related\r\nvariations in the concentrations of mercury in blood of the Blue-footed\r\nBooby.Read more: Full\r\nPublication\r\n2016\r\n1.\r\nEnvironmentally-mediated flexible foraging strategies in Brown Boobies\r\nin the Gulf of California\r\nAuthors: Castillo-Guerrero JA, Lerma\r\nM, Mellink E, Suazo-Guillén E, Peñaloza-Padilla EAAbstract The Brown Booby Sula leucogaster is a\r\nseabird with a pantropical distribution across a wide variety of oceanic\r\nenvironments. Sexual size dimorphism in Brown Boobies has been proposed\r\nas an explanation for intersexual differences in foraging, but results\r\nhave been inconsistent. We investigated whether there is\r\ncontext-dependent foraging behaviour driven by local environmental\r\nconditions. In this study, we evaluated (1) inter-sex differences in\r\nforaging behaviour (by capillary tubes, temperature and depth recorders,\r\nand diet) at two colonies in the Gulf of California: Isla San Jorge\r\n(ISJ) and Farallón de San Ignacio (FSI) and, (2) intercolonial and\r\ninterannual differences in foraging behaviour, and (at ISJ) their\r\nrelationship with local-scale environmental variation, using 5-day\r\ncomposite images of sea surface temperature (SST) and primary\r\nproductivity (PP) as proxies. Inter-sex differences were few and\r\ninconsistent between years, and smaller than overall differences between\r\nyears and localities. At ISJ, Brown Boobies included more prey species\r\nin their diet (27 vs. 19 spp.) and dove shallower (2.3 vs. 3.14 m) than\r\nat FSI. At ISJ, Brown Boobies exhibited adjustments in diving depth and\r\nprey size as a function of environmental variation: shallower plunge\r\ndives and smaller prey items were related with lower SST and higher PP\r\nvalues, whereas deeper dives and larger prey items were related with\r\nhigher SST and lower PP values. Our results confirmed that the Brown\r\nBooby is highly plastic in its foraging ecology, which explains its\r\nability to live in places with large-scale environmental variation\r\n(intercolony and interannual), such as tropical areas worldwide.Read more: Full Publication\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
