My research interests include conservation, ecology, physiology and ecotoxicology. I work with coastal and marine animals mostly with shorebirds and seabirds. My goal is to know more about their lives in order to improve the conservation efforts.\r\nI am currently working on analyzing spatial patterns of marine animals while collaborating with projects in Mexico and Chile. Also, I am a teaching R to technicians and students from my home town, Mazatlán. You can find the materials from my class (which are in Spanish) at this webpage.\r\nI am very passionate about nature, R and QGIS.\r\nIf you are interested in some collaboration or have specific questions I am happy to help!\r\nJust email me! \r\nI speak Spanish, English and a little bit of German.\r\n Education\r\nDr. rer. nat. | University of KielMaster en Marine Sciences | Universidad Nacional Autonoma de MexicoBA in Biology | Universidad de Guadalajara\r\n Recent Roles\r\nData analyst | Research and Technology Center (FTZ), University of Kiel | Present\r\n Trainings\r\nAniMove Summer school | Max Planck Institute | 2018Scientific Writing | Integrated School of Ocean Sciences | 2017International Summer School on Stable Isotopes in Animal Ecology | Centre for Stable Isotope Ecology in Berlin-Brandenburg | 2017GIS for Marine Sciences | Integrated School of Ocean Sciences | 2016\r\n Contact\r\nDr. rer. nat.
