### `r fa("chevron-circle-down", fill = "black")` About  me

I am a postdoctoral researcher at West Coast Research and Technology Center [FTZ](https://www.ftz.uni-kiel.de/de) in BÃ¼sum, Germany and part of the Seevogelmonitoring team at the Dachverband Deutscher Avifaunisten [DDA](https://www.dda-web.de/). 

My work entitles analyzing spatial patterns of marine animals while collaborating on active projects in Mexico and Chile. My focus is coastal and marine animals, in particular shorebirds and seabirds. My research interests include conservation, ecology, physiology, and ecotoxicology. You can download my cv [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MiriamLL/Curriculum/master/CV/CV-Lerma.pdf). 

I am passionate about nature, biology, and outdoor activities (hiking, kayaking, snorkelling).

**Teaching**  
I prepared materials for training technicians and students in [R](https://www.r-project.org/about.html), a programming language for statistical computing and graphics. If you are interested in accessing the materials for this class, which is taught remotely, you can locate them [here](https://www.miriam-lerma.com/materiales.html), please note that these materials are in Spanish. 
<br>

I develop R [packages](https://www.miriam-lerma.com/projects.html) that are useful for my work. Instructions are in Spanish, but a link to the English translation at github is provided. 
<br>
**Blog**  
I blog about what I consider could be useful to other people. Most ideas come from people asking me how to do something in particular, something that I was learning at the moment. I write in English and Spanish.
