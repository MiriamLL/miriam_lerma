### `r fa("chevron-circle-down", fill = "black")` About  me
I am a postdoctoral researcher at West Coast Research and Technology Center [FTZ](https://www.ftz.uni-kiel.de/de) in BÃ¼sum, Germany. 

My work entitles analyzing spatial patterns of marine animals while collaborating on active projects in Mexico and Chile. My focus is coastal and marine animals, in particular shorebirds and seabirds. 

Currently, I am training technicians and students in [R](https://www.r-project.org/about.html), a programming language for statistical computing and graphics. If you are interested in accessing the materials for this class, which is taught remotely to students in Mexico, you can locate them [here](https://www.miriam-lerma.com/materiales.html), please note that these materials are in Spanish. 

My research interests include conservation, ecology, physiology, and ecotoxicology. 
I am passionate about nature, open science, and outdoor activities.   

If you are interested in a collaboration, or have any questions, please feel free to email me.
